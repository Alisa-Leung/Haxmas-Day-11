# Alisa's Blog
This project was built for Day 11 of Hack Club's Haxmas on December 23, 2025.\

This is a blog made using Astro that allows for posts to be made and rendered with simple markdown files. Beyond the workshop, I added simple styling and animations to add a personal touch, and I wrote 2 short posts as placeholders.
