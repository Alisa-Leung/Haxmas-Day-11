For Day 10 of Haxmas, I built a small runner game with Lua, where you play as a determined snail trying to survive in a world full of salt (oh no!). You must run, jump, and roll your way past obstacles before they get the best of you.\
<br>
The workshop provided a nice foundation for the game and general logic, which I added onto through animations, pixel art, and the roll mechanic. Through these additions, I incorporated my own personal touch.\
<br>
Overall, I am really happy with the way it turned out, and I look forward to experimenting with Lua and Love2d in future projects.
