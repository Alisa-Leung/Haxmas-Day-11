## This project was made for Day 11 of Haxmas!

For Day 11 of Haxmas, I got the chance to work with Astro, a framework I have not tried before. The workshop guided me through the setup, and I am quite happy with the results after adding some personal touches.\

The component system and file-based routing of Astro made it really easy to follow along, and I enjoyed seeing how everything fit together. It was incredibly flexible to work with, and I loved the organized structure.\

Once I got the overall site and other basics in place, I decided to experiment with the look and feel of the pages by adding some styling and personal touches. I really enjoyed adding some of my own design.
